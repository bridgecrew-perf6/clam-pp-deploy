              Created gameloop with a stabilized frame rate of 100fps on all computers/browsers. Did this by
              implementing a gameloop which ingests the current timestamp, and checks the difference between the last
              timestamp. If the change in time is >= 10 milliseconds, the next frame is updated. As a new frame is
              loaded 100 times a second, the game framerate is cemented at 100 frames per second regardless of the
              user's browser speed.
            </li><br>
            <li>Implemented a simple gamestate design pattern to manage the different phases of the game. At any given
              time, one gamestate is active (like a Pause gamestate, Menu gamestate, etc.), and going to other
              gamestates changes elements like the background image, active functions, etc.</li>

      <textbox class="js-scroll">
        <p>I'm a tech professional, born and raised in Vancouver, Canada, looking to
          find work as a developer.
          <br><br>
          As I mentioned in the website intro, I've never formally worked as a software engineer,
          but I've been self-study programming full-time since July 2021.
        </p>
        <p>
          More specifically, I've focused on learning object-oriented programming in Python, and web development with
          HTML + CSS + Javascript.
        </p>

      <button onclick="toggleShow101()" id="showBtn101">⬇ What's your educational background? ⬇</button>
    </textbox>

      <textbox class="js-scroll">
        <p>I hold a degree in Commerce from UBC.
        </p>

    <!-- FAQ 3 -->

    <textbox>
      <br><br>
      <button onclick="toggleShow102()" id="showBtn102">⬇ Why are you entering software development? ⬇</button>
    </textbox>

    <textcontainer id="more102">
      <textbox class="js-scroll">
        <p>To give my top three reasons:</p>
        <p>1. From my years of experience studying, interning, and working in the tech sector, I've become
          familiar with the life and work of software developers. I believe my personality and
          work-style matches very well with this line of work.
        </p>
        <p>2. Having worked in IT helpdesk and SAAS technical support, I have an intimate insight
          into the behavior, goals, and struggles of the technology end-user. <br>
          I'm also familiar with the many difficulties and bugs that users and
          developers deal with in complex pieces of software.<br>
          I believe this customer focus and software development insight
          I've built and demonstrated throughout my career will
          give me an edge in developing usable and functional software.
        </p>
        <p>3. Though I'm still relatively early in the stages of building a career in technology,
          my long-term goal is to become the best technology professional I can be.
          Working as a software developer is my next step in that long-term goal.

          </p>
          <p>I'm a tech professional, born and raised in Vancouver, Canada, looking to
            find work as a developer.
            <br><br>
            As I mentioned in the website intro, I've never formally worked as a software engineer,
            but I've been self-study programming full-time since July 2021.
          </p>
          <p>
            More specifically, I've focused on learning object-oriented programming in Python, and web development with
            HTML + CSS + Javascript.

            It was heavy, beige, and was strictly for "homework only". It wasn't event connected to the internet.
            <br><br>
            But that didn't stop me from
            spending hours playing with Space Pinball, Minesweeper, and making custom Starcraft maps.

          <p class="js-scroll">
            I proved to myself that, with just a computer, the internet, and some good 'ol dedication, I could learn

            Yep! I would say this was an early precursor to what I'd be doing today, self-learning programming.
            But there was even more forces that pushed me towards a career in tech.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through my later high school years, continued my self-studies in technology and computing. I helped
            people with their computer problems, learned to
            <span class="tooltip-wide">build websites<span class="tooltip-widetext">
                Solely with Wordpress. Thinking back on those websites makes me cringe-- they were bad.</span></span>,
            and even <span class="tooltip-wide">dabbled in programming.<span class="tooltip-widetext">
                Though nothing ever came of it; just learned some python syntax and made some ultra-basic
                projects</span></span>
          </p>
          <p class="js-scroll">
            It was in these teenage years where, as you can imagine, I became the local IT support resource
            for my friends, family, and more.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p class="js-scroll">
            By the time graduation rolled around and it was time to choose my next steps, though,
            I didn't end up applying to Computer Science programs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Instead, I elected to study business.

          <p class="js-scroll">
            It felt like the most natural choice for me at the time; a close mentor I had in my youth was an
            entrepreneur,
            and many of my role models were business-people. It was an easy choice for me to apply to business schools.
          </p>
          <p class="js-scroll">
            And although I was a shy student, I figured it'd help me open up more, and
            <span class="tooltip-wide">gain social confidence.<span class="tooltip-widetext">
                It did. But, not going to lie, it was really difficult being in business school as an introvert
                / socially anxious person. However, I'm glad I did it, and there's no question
                it made me more socially capable</span></span>

          </p>
          <p class="js-scroll">
            I had my eyes set on the
            Business Technology Management major at UBC's prestigious Sauder business school.
            Here was the program for me, I thought. I can study business and technology concurrently. Perfect.

          <p>
            But I would always fall into the same pithole of watching tutorials for a few weeks,
            learning a language's syntax, but never continuing long enough to build anything meaningful.

          <p>
            But why did I choose to self-learn instead of going back to school, or doing a bootcamp? A few reasons:

        </textbox>
        <textbox>
          <paragbox>
            <p>
              • Cost. The local 12-week bootcamps I looked at often costed $10,000+. A very large sum, for
              me at least<br>
              • Time. I didn't mind the cost of going back to school for a formal 2-year+ program, but
              I didn't want to spend that much time out of the workforce, especially since I was fresh out of my
              Bachelor's degree <br>
              • Experience. I wasn't completely new to coding at this point. During my business technology management
              degree,
              I took coding courses wherever possible. Because of this previous exposure, I could get up to speed
              quicker.
              And it would be more efficient to self-learn, because I could create my own curriculum and start right
              where I left off.

            I started by completing a book, Python Crash Course, and built many little
            Python projects during this, including the
            Learning Log project above (which was a capstone project in the book)
          </p>
          <p>
            Then, I used youtube tutorials to learn Javascript. That's when I started working on the Foodstand Clam
            game, in the Portfolio section
            above.

            With this experience in Javascript, I refreshed my HTML / CSS skills, and coded this portfolio website.

            I'm a car enthusiast. I bought my first car in 2019, a 2004 BMW 325i, and fell in love with it. But it broke
            a
            lot.
            With the power of the internet, I learned to DIY most of the major
            repairs on this car.
            The most difficult repair so far has been the CCV oil seperation system (a rite of passage for BMW
            e46 enthusiasts).<br><br>
            Owning and maintaining this car has become a beloved hobby of mine, and I want to
            keep owning and wrenching on these old German cars forever.
            <br><br>
            In 2020, this e46 was joined by a new project: a rough-running 1995 e34 BMW 540i. It's
            280 horsepower of V8 engine fun, and I'm in the process of restoring it mechanically now.

          <p>
            One of the best parts about learning how to work on these cars,
            is the joy of getting to drive a well maintained
            '90s / early 2000's german automobile. These things are so balanced,
            fun to drive, while having four doors and easily taking me to Superstore every week. Brilliant.

            I'm a sucker for a good personal finance/investing thought piece.

            Some of my favorite finance writers/thinkers whom I owe my investing approach to,
            and thus all my portfolio gains to, are
