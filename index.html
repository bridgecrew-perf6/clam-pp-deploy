              Created gameloop with a stabilized frame rate of 100fps on all computers/browsers. Did this by
              implementing a gameloop which ingests the current timestamp, and checks the difference between the last
              timestamp. If the change in time is >= 10 milliseconds, the next frame is updated. As a new frame is
              loaded 100 times a second, the game framerate is cemented at 100 frames per second regardless of the
              user's browser speed.
            </li><br>
            <li>Implemented a simple gamestate design pattern to manage the different phases of the game. At any given
              time, one gamestate is active (like a Pause gamestate, Menu gamestate, etc.), and going to other
              gamestates changes elements like the background image, active functions, etc.</li>

        My mentor I had in my youth (and still have to this day) was an entrepreneur,

          It did. But, not going to lie, it was really difficult being in business school as an introvert

      it made me more socially capable</span></span>,

      <p>
        The first thing I'd like to mention is that I was a nerdy kid.</p>
      <p>
        When I was eleven or twelve, my favorite place to be was infront of my family's Windows Vista PC
        , without internet access,
        playing Minesweeper and making custom maps on Starcraft.</p>
    </blockquotecenter>

    <blockquotecenter class="js-scroll">

        Playing endlessly with this PC was the beginning of my intrigue with technology and computing.

    <blockquotecenter class="js-scroll">
      <p>
        Soon enough, my parents hooked up our PC to the internet,
        And it let me indulge my intrigue with tech.
        building PCs became my first real hobby, and
        I even built a few websites for school projects and such in my teen years.

      </p>
      <p>I even
        dabbled in learning to code around this age (though nothing came of it at the time)

      <h4>
        <br>
        Thanks for taking the time to read all of that, if you did.
        If you're done with all the professional talk and just want to
        hear about the stuff I'm interested in, I've written a bit about my that below:
      </h4>

      <h4>
        <br>
        When I'm not coding, I'm...
        <br> <br> <br>

      </h4>

      <h4>
        ○ Working on my car
      </h4>
      <blockquotesmall>
        <p>
          I'm a car enthusiast. I bought my first car in 2019, a 2004 BMW 325i, and fell in love with it. But it broke a
          lot.
          With the power of the internet, I learned to DIY most of the major
          repairs on this car.
          The most difficult repair so far has been the CCV oil seperation system (a rite of passage for BMW
          e46 enthusiasts).<br><br>
          Owning and maintaining this car has become a beloved hobby of mine, and I want to
          keep owning and wrenching on these old German cars forever.
          <br><br>
          In 2020, this e46 was joined by a new project: a rough-running 1995 e34 BMW 540i. It's
          280 horsepower of V8 engine fun, and I'm in the process of restoring it mechanically now.
        </p>
      </blockquotesmall>

      <h4>
        ○ Driving my car
      </h4>
      <blockquotesmall>
        <p>
          One of the best parts about learning how to work on these cars,
          is the joy of getting to drive a well maintained
          '90s / early 2000's german automobile. These things are so balanced,
          fun to drive, while having four doors and easily taking me to Superstore every week. Brilliant.
        </p>
      </blockquotesmall>

      <h4>
        ○ Reading finance and investing material
      </h4>
      <blockquotesmall>
        <p>
          I'm a sucker for a good personal finance/investing thought piece.
          I'm a DIY investor, with an investment style heavily influenced by the passive indexing school of thought.
          I'm all about getting the market return, making long-term bets,
          and I still believe in waiting for reasonable valuations.
          <br><br>
          Some of my favorite finance writers/thinkers whom I owe my investing approach to,
          and thus all my portfolio gains to, are
          William Bernstein, Burton Malkiel, Robert Shiller, just to name a few.
        </p>
      </blockquotesmall>

      <h4>
        ○ Playing games
      </h4>
      <blockquotesmall>
        <p>
          My all-time favorite games are Minecraft, Halo 2, Maplestory, and Skyrim. Maybe not the most
          sophistocated games, but I've spent probably at least 10% of my waking life playing these games.
          Right now, I'm playing a lot of Horizon Zero Dawn. Big fan of open world games-- really stirs the imagination!
