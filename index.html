              Created gameloop with a stabilized frame rate of 100fps on all computers/browsers. Did this by
              implementing a gameloop which ingests the current timestamp, and checks the difference between the last
              timestamp. If the change in time is >= 10 milliseconds, the next frame is updated. As a new frame is
              loaded 100 times a second, the game framerate is cemented at 100 frames per second regardless of the
              user's browser speed.
            </li><br>
            <li>Implemented a simple gamestate design pattern to manage the different phases of the game. At any given
              time, one gamestate is active (like a Pause gamestate, Menu gamestate, etc.), and going to other
              gamestates changes elements like the background image, active functions, etc.</li>

      <p class="js-scroll">
        In my youth, there were a few landmark moments that <span class="tooltip-wide">predisposed me to a career in
          technology.<span class="tooltip-widetext">
            and predisposed me to being a nerdy guy in general</span>

      <p class="js-scroll">
        First was around the age of 10, when my parents brought home a Windows Vista PC.
      </p>
      <p class="js-scroll">
        It was heavy, beige, and was strictly for "homework only". It wasn't event connected to the internet. <br><br>
        But that didn't stop me from
        spending hours playing with Space Pinball, Minesweeper, and making custom Starcraft maps.

        The next landmark moment was during high school.
        I got my own computer with wifi connection, and <span class="tooltip-wide">I could not get enough of it<span
            class="tooltip-widetext">
            Just ask my parents </span></span>.
        <br>Eventually it led me into my first internet-acquired skill: PC building.

      </p>
      <p class="js-scroll">
        When I was 15, with the power of
        Google, Youtube, and Reddit,
        I ordered parts and successfully built my first custom PC. When I saw it spin to life for the first time,
        I realized something huge:
      </p>
      <p class="js-scroll">
        I proved to myself that, with just a computer, the internet, and some good 'ol dedication, I could learn real,
        practical skills. For free.

          Yep!
        </p>
        <p>
        Through my later high school years, continued my self-studies in technology and computing. I helped
        people with their computer problems, learned to
        <span class="tooltip-wide">build websites<span class="tooltip-widetext">
            Solely with Wordpress. Thinking back on those websites makes me cringe-- they were bad.</span></span>,
        and even <span class="tooltip-wide">dabbled in programming.<span class="tooltip-widetext">

      </p>
      <br>
      <p class="js-scroll">
        But by the time graduation rolled around and it was time to choose my next steps,

        My mentor I had in my youth (and still have to this day) was an entrepreneur,
        and many of my role models were business-people, so it felt very natural for me to go to business school.
      </p>
      <p class="js-scroll">
        And although I was a shy student, I figured it'd help me open up more, and
        <span class="tooltip-wide">gain social confidence.<span class="tooltip-widetext">
            It did. But, not going to lie, it was really difficult being in business school as an introvert
            / socially anxious person. However, I'm glad I did it, and there's no question
            it made me more socially capable</span></span>,

        I had my eyes set on the

          I'm a car enthusiast. I bought my first car in 2019, a 2004 BMW 325i, and fell in love with it. But it broke a
          lot.
          With the power of the internet, I learned to DIY most of the major

          The most difficult repair so far has been the CCV oil seperation system (a rite of passage for BMW

          Owning and maintaining this car has become a beloved hobby of mine, and I want to

          In 2020, this e46 was joined by a new project: a rough-running 1995 e34 BMW 540i. It's

          One of the best parts about learning how to work on these cars,
          is the joy of getting to drive a well maintained
          '90s / early 2000's german automobile. These things are so balanced,
          fun to drive, while having four doors and easily taking me to Superstore every week. Brilliant.

          I'm a sucker for a good personal finance/investing thought piece.
          I'm a DIY investor, with an investment style heavily influenced by the passive indexing school of thought.
          I'm all about getting the market return, making long-term bets,
          and I still believe in waiting for reasonable valuations.

          Some of my favorite finance writers/thinkers whom I owe my investing approach to,
          and thus all my portfolio gains to, are
          William Bernstein, Burton Malkiel, Robert Shiller, just to name a few.

          My all-time favorite games are Minecraft, and Skyrim. Maybe not the most
          sophistocated games, but I've spent probably at least 10% of my waking life playing these games.
          Right now, I'm playing a lot of Horizon Zero Dawn. Big fan of open world games-- really stirs the imagination!

        GOOD CHANGE: instead of changing display to "none" to hide hidden text,
        referencing an answer in https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2928688/how-to-hide-elements-without-having-them-take-space-on-the-page/25515420
        I instead chose to move hidden text off-screen
