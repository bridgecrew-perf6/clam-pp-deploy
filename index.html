            <li>Used empty arrays to represent game objects like bullets, coins, npcs, etc.
              Interactions between these gameobjects, collision handling, as well as input handling from the user, are handled with Javascript functions.
              Game variables are 'upgradable', so the user can increase the "food" spawn rate, and decrease the "enemy" spawn rate with in-game upgrades.
              User "lives" are tracked to end the game after sufficient losses. 
              </li>
              <li>
              Simulated random "enemy" generation and movement by using a random integer function, and performing actions according to the random integer generated 
            </li>
            <li>
              Created gameloop with a stabilized frame rate of 100fps on all computers/browsers. Did this by
              implementing a gameloop which ingests the current timestamp, and checks the difference between the last
              timestamp. If the change in time is >= 10 milliseconds, the next frame is updated. This means a new frame is
              loaded 100 times a second, so the game framerate is cemented at 100 frames per second regardless of the
              user's browser speed.
            </li>
            <li>Implemented a simple gamestate design pattern to manage the different phases of the game. At any given
              time, one gamestate is active (like a Pause gamestate, Menu gamestate, etc.), which controls
               elements like the background image, active functions, etc.</li>

    </textbox>

    <textcontainer id="more100">
      <textbox>
        <p>I'm a tech professional, born + raised + currently based out of in Vancouver, Canada. looking to
          find work as a developer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prior to pursuing a developer role, I've worked as a Technical Support Analyst for two years,
          using my technical acumen to support
          <a href="https://www.visier.com/" target="_blank">Visier's</a> SAAS data analytics web application
        </p>
      </textbox>
      <textbox>
        <p>
          But I was always a technologist, even before joining Visier.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my university days, I worked in IT help-desk on campus at
          <a href="https://psych.ubc.ca/" target="_blank">UBC's Dept. of Psychology</a>, making sure the faculty +
          students + staff
          all had exactly what they needed IT-wise to perform their research and classes.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also interned for 12 months in a Pre-sales role at <a href="https://www.appnovation.com/"
            target="_blank">Appnovation</a>, a Technology Services company
          specializing in open source technologies.
        </p>
        <p>And had a 4-month summer internship as a Jr. Business Analyst for
          BC's healthcare's <a href="https://cstproject.ca/" target="_blank">Clinical & Systems Transformation (CST)</a>
          project.
        </p>
      </textbox>
      <textbox>
        <p>
          Now, I’m making the next step in my career, transitioning from being a support technician, to becoming a
          software developer

    </textbox>

    <textcontainer id="more101">
      <textbox>
        <p>
          In 2019, I graduated from the <a href="https://cstproject.ca/" target="_blank">University of British
            Columbia</a> (UBC)
        </p>
        <p>
          I earned a Bachelor's of Commerce in <a href="https://cstproject.ca/" target="_blank">Business Technology
            Management</a>.
          <br>
          Despite getting a business degree, I had my sights set on working in the tech industry going into this degree.
          <br>
          This is reflected in the major I chose, the computer science electives I took, and the extra-curriculars I got
          involved with throughout my university career.

        <textbox>
          <p>
            There are a few reasons:
          </p>
        </textbox>
        <textbox>
          <p>
            The first would be that business disciplines (particularly entrepreneurship, finance,
            and business analysis) interest me greatly.<br>
            I'd consider myself a business person just as much as I am a technologist.
          </p>
          <p>
            Second, I've been lucky enough to have a great mentor in my youth who's a businessman.
            He influenced me greatly and piqued my interest in entrepreneurship and finance.
          </p>
          <p>
            Three, I figured going into a business degree would be good for building my soft-skills.
          </p>
        </textbox>
        <textbox>
          <p>
            Between these factors, it just felt natural to into a business program.
          </p>

        <!-- Nested FAQ: Would you go back? -->

        <br><br>
        <button onclick="toggleShow105()" id="showBtn105">If you could go back, would you change your degree?</button>

      <textcontainer id="more105">
        <textbox>
          <p>
            Well, I often think about how much easier it'd be to get my first Dev role if
            I completed a formal education in computer science/programming.
          </p>
          <p>
            But ultimately, though it might make me harder to hire for some companies,
            I do take pride in self-learning development.
          </p>
          <p>
            I think being a self-taught developer
            is a powerful demonstration of my intrinsic motivation towards continuous, life-long learning.
          </p>
          <p>
            And at the end of the day, I believe that all devs have to be "self taught" to some degree--<br>
            Web technologies grow and mutate so quickly that it seems the learning never stops in this profession.
          </p>
          <p>
            So I can confidently say I'm happy with being a business school grad trying to be a Dev;
            and having a sharp business acumen and strong customer focus will make me a very well-rounded
            developer in the end.

      <textbox class="js-scroll">
        <p>
          I've tried to "learn to code" many times throughout my life. I think this is a relatable experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'd always get through a few Python tutorials, learn syntax, and even make a simple Pong game or Sodoku
          solver--
        </p>
        <p>

      <textbox>
        <p>
          It wasn't until my last role with Visier ended in June 2021, when I decided to try to "learn to code" for the

      <textcontainer id="more106">
        <textbox>
          <p>
            After working in a variety of different roles and companies in the technology industry,
            I've noticed a universal truth in this business: developers are powerful.
          </p>
          <p>
            More specifically, competent developers are powerful. Every company I've worked at seems
            to have at least one top-tier developer who knows everything and can do anything.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now that I've paid my dues on the front lines in Support roles, I'm now professionally confident
            enough to know I can be a great asset to a company as a developer.
          </p>
          <p>
            And one day I hope to one of those indespensible, "knows everything", wizard-level Developers
          </p>
          <p>
            Right now, that's my ultimate professional goal.

        <button onclick="toggleShow107()" id="showBtn107">2. Alignment with personal and professional values</button>
      </textbox>
      <textcontainer id="more107">
        <textbox>
          <p>
            When I think back on my career, I've neve been married to any particular job title.
          </p>
          <p>
            But I've realized that I brought the same personal/professional values to each role:
          </p>
          <p>
            One of those values is lifetime learning. I feel most accomplished when I'm improving in something, or
            learning something new.
          </p>
          <p>
            This translates well to the field of software development, where the learning never ceases.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another of those values is that I take a lot of pride in my work. When I'm responsible for a piece of work,
            I'm
            often not satisfied unless it's completed to a standard of quality at which I can be proud of my work.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even though this has made me slower to finish tickets in my Support days,
            I believe it's much more beneficial as a Dev, where quality & organized code
            is, from what I think, infitely better than quick hacky fixes.

      <textcontainer id="more108">
        <textbox>
          <p>
            Over the years, I've developed a deep knowledge of how I work best,
            when my best thinking occurs, and what type of work environment I’m most happy + productive in.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've found that my best work comes out of long, concentrated work sessions where I can
            thrash away at a problem/project for hours. Once I hit my stride and enter a flow state,
            my motivation is highest and my mind is sharpest.
          </p>
          <p>
            This work style has served me very well while learning to program.
            It undoubtedly can be mentally strenuous to be staring at a text editor
            for hours on end. However, once I hit my stride, I can't stop.
            I'll often end up hacking away at features all night.

          However, the absolutely most important element of my learning has been a
          project-based mindset.

        <p>
          With a project-based learning mentality, I learn only what I need to get started with

          I don't think I'm there yet at the full-stack level.
          But my Foodstand Clam project plus this personal website have helped me build a
          solid grasp of programming with web technologies like HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
        </p>
        <p>
          So right now, I believe I’d fit best in a Front End Developer role, or a Web Developer role.
        </p>
        <p>
          That said, I’m currently practicing implementing the REST API tech stack, in order to code full-stack
          applications.
          I would absolutely love the challenge of a Jr. Full Stack Dev role.

            Yep! I would say this was an early precursor to what I'd be doing today, self-learning programming.
            But there was even more forces that pushed me towards a career in tech.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through my later high school years, continued my self-studies in technology and computing. I helped
            people with their computer problems, learned to
            <span class="tooltip-wide">build websites<span class="tooltip-widetext">
                Solely with Wordpress. Thinking back on those websites makes me cringe-- they were bad.</span></span>,
            and even <span class="tooltip-wide">dabbled in programming.<span class="tooltip-widetext">
                Though nothing ever came of it; just learned some python syntax and made some ultra-basic
                projects</span></span>

          <p class="js-scroll">
            It was in these teenage years where, as you can imagine, I became the local IT support resource
            for my friends, family, and more.

          <br>
          <p class="js-scroll">
            By the time graduation rolled around and it was time to choose my next steps, though,
            I didn't end up applying to Computer Science programs.
          </p>
          <p>

          <p class="js-scroll">
            It felt like the most natural choice for me at the time; a close mentor I had in my youth was an
            entrepreneur,
            and many of my role models were business-people. It was an easy choice for me to apply to business schools.
          </p>
          <p class="js-scroll">
            And although I was a shy student, I figured it'd help me open up more, and
            <span class="tooltip-wide">gain social confidence.<span class="tooltip-widetext">
                It did. But, not going to lie, it was really difficult being in business school as an introvert
                / socially anxious person. However, I'm glad I did it, and there's no question
                it made me more socially capable</span></span>

          </p>
          <p class="js-scroll">
            I had my eyes set on the

            I want to be a technology professional. And I want to be the best one I could be. Maybe even be CTO material

            By that point in my life, I've tried to "learn to code" more times than
            I can remember.
          </p>
          <p>
            But I would always fall into the same pithole of watching tutorials for a few weeks,
            learning a language's syntax, but never continuing long enough to build anything meaningful.
          </p>
          <p>
            This time, though, I focused. This was the best opportunity I'd get; it was now or never.
          </p>
          <p>
            But why did I choose to self-learn instead of going back to school, or doing a bootcamp? A few reasons:

        </textbox>
        <textbox>
          <paragbox>
            <p>
              • Cost. The local 12-week bootcamps I looked at often costed $10,000+. A very large sum, for
              me at least<br>
              • Time. I didn't mind the cost of going back to school for a formal 2-year+ program, but
              I didn't want to spend that much time out of the workforce, especially since I was fresh out of my
              Bachelor's degree <br>
              • Experience. I wasn't completely new to coding at this point. During my business technology management
              degree,
              I took coding courses wherever possible. Because of this previous exposure, I could get up to speed
              quicker.
              And it would be more efficient to self-learn, because I could create my own curriculum and start right
              where I left off.

            I started by completing a book, Python Crash Course, and built many little
            Python projects during this, including the
            Learning Log project above (which was a capstone project in the book)
          </p>
          <p>
            Then, I used youtube tutorials to learn Javascript. That's when I started working on the Foodstand Clam
            game, in the Portfolio section
            above.

            With this experience in Javascript, I refreshed my HTML / CSS skills, and coded this portfolio website.

            I'm a car enthusiast. I bought my first car in 2019, a 2004 BMW 325i, and fell in love with it. But it broke
            a
            lot.
            With the power of the internet, I learned to DIY most of the major
            repairs on this car.
            The most difficult repair so far has been the CCV oil seperation system (a rite of passage for BMW
            e46 enthusiasts).<br><br>
            Owning and maintaining this car has become a beloved hobby of mine, and I want to
            keep owning and wrenching on these old German cars forever.
            <br><br>
            In 2020, this e46 was joined by a new project: a rough-running 1995 e34 BMW 540i. It's
            280 horsepower of V8 engine fun, and I'm in the process of restoring it mechanically now.

          <p>
            One of the best parts about learning how to work on these cars,
            is the joy of getting to drive a well maintained
            '90s / early 2000's german automobile. These things are so balanced,
            fun to drive, while having four doors and easily taking me to Superstore every week. Brilliant.

            I'm a sucker for a good personal finance/investing thought piece.

            Some of my favorite finance writers/thinkers whom I owe my investing approach to,
